Smart-WDC is a full-fledged product which can be placed in public places. 
We believe, our surroundings can be made much cleaner if people can be incentivized to throw thrash in garbage-bins.


Currently, there isn't any form of incentive for people to dispose/throw garbage in thrash-bins, especially in public places where there are lots of hawkers/stores selling products in disposable containers. Our solution is aimed to solve that problem in a way it's beneficial to everyone (Thrash-producers(hawkers), thrash-disposer and the environment)
Till now, we haven't found any company which has a product similar to us.


Our team is the "special sauce" that we have. We all have good sense of saving environment and at the same time tech-capbilities to create a product/solution.

Since, this is a huge problem, with no products existing to solve it, entering market wouldn't be that difficult.
There is a huge market for this.


This product will incitivize people on using the thrash-bins (as simple as that). It doesn't need any form of education/training to use it.
We can increase the height of the bin, so this doesn't encourage child-labour in any form.
