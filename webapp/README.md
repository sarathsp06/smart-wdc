## Use code
To use the code, first install the JavaScript dependencies by running  

```
yran install
yarn build
```

Then start the local budo web server by running 

```
yarn start
```

This will start a web server on [`localhost:9966`](http://localhost:9966). Try and allow permission to your webcam, and add some examples by holding down the buttons.
